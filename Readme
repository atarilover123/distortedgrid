Quick and hacky version of Paketa12's TouchDesigner Elastic grid tutorial in Processing.
Currently each block represents color value of 1 pixel - mods/improvements could come from sampling the image position using get or copy.
The grid math is a little off (expand the sketch size and remove frame to see)
